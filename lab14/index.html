	<p> Lab 14 was an opportunity to clean up our webpage using debugging strategies.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>We both encountered problems when we tried to get an output for lab 10.
</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> I was able to add lab 6 into my homepage (for some reason I forgot to add it to my html), add pictures for my lab 5 page, and get lab 10 working.
