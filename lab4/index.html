	<h2>Challege:</h2>
		<p>The purpose of Lab 4 is to introduce us to how to plan and think about
		implementing a program step by step via the usage of high-level tasks.</p>
	<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>It was challenging to start each step of the program with a clear
		and concise action that could describe exactly what we wanted to accomplish.
		It was also difficult to stay consistent to a certain level of abstraction
		when describing the task.</p>
 	<h2>Results:</h2>
