	<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>Olivia's favorite things are strawberries, bike rides, the farmers
			market, and spending time with her friends and family. Cole's favorite
			things are programming, exploring new places, riding his bike, and listening to
			music. As you can see, we both like to ride bikes and are both second
			year students at UCSC. But, Cole is from San Dimas and Olivia is from
			Chicago. We both have brown hair and have the same TA, Brock. </p>
